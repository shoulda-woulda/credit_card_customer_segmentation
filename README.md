Credit Card Customer Segmentation using K-Means Analysis

Overview: This project focuses on the segmentation of credit card customers using K-Means Analysis. The dataset, provided by the data engineering team, contains valuable customer information for a credit card company. The primary objective is to leverage K-Means clustering to categorize customers into distinct groups, enabling the application of tailored business strategies for each customer type.

Purpose: Credit card companies often face challenges in customising their services and marketing strategies for a diverse customer base. By employing K-Means Analysis, we aim to identify homogeneous customer groups based on their behavior, transaction patterns and other relevant features. This segmentation will empower the company to implement targeted approaches, optimising customer satisfaction and business performance.
